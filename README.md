Add, edit, and delete transactions (income/expenses).


Categorize transactions (with predefined and custom categories).


Set and track monthly budgets.


View summary reports (total income, expenses, balance, remaining budget).


Filter transactions by type, category, month, or keyword.


Persist data locally (via browser storage) and support import/export in JSON format.


The system is intended for individual users and does not require a server backend.
1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, Abbreviations
Transaction: A financial record of either an income or an expense.


Category: A label assigned to a transaction (e.g., Food, Rent, Salary).


Budget: A monthly financial target/limit set by the user for expenses.


Local Storage: Browser-based persistent storage.
